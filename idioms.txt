When push comes to shove
When the chips are down
Where the rubber meets the road
Where were we?
White elephant
White lie
Whitewash
Who asked you?
Who do you think you are?
Whole ball of wax
Wild and woolly
Will take place
Wine and dine
Winging it
With bated breath
With bells on
With flying colors
Wolf in sheep's clothing
Work against the clock
Worth one's salt
Wouldn't be caught dead
Wouldn't hurt a fly
Wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole
Wrap your head around something
X marks the spot
You bet
You can bet your boots
You can bet your bottom dollar
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can say that again
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs
You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip
You can't take it with you
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You get what you pay for
You'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You're telling me
You've sold me
Your guess is as good as mine
Zero tolerance
Zip it
